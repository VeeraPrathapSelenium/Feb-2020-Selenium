Looping statements:

looping statements are used to execute same statement for a specific number of times


To paramnetrize the data via variables we can also use loops

Java supports

	* for
	* while
	* do while
	* for each

for loop is called as definite loop, it will have a starting point and a ending point

endingpoint defines that how many time, your loop should run or execute

for(int somevar;somecondition;somevar++){
}

Using for loop can you print a 5 table

5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 =10
5 * 3 =15

5 * 20 =100


While loop:
===========

this loop is called as indefinte loop

it will check very first the condition is true, if true it allows to enter into the body, else it will not allow

when the condition is true, we must ensure that we have a failing condition available.

else , the loop will keep running without a break;

this will leads to performance leaks


Do While:
=========
This will not check for any condition on the first time
It will execute body
On second iteration on wards, it will check for condition

Here at least once my code will get executed.
