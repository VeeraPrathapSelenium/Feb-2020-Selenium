How to start writting java program?

==================================

Every user must write the program in a class file

Ther is structure that must be maintain on the classfile

Syntax of a class:
------------------


class ClassName{





}

if the there is no main method available, the program will not get executed but it will get compiled


Can my classname be a duplicate?

No.


I got to know what is the structure of a class, inside the class where can i write the logic or programs?

User must write the programs with in the curly brackets

But we must think about the inner components of a class

There are 5 major components of a class available

	* Variables
	* Methods
	* Constructor
	* Static Block
	* Instance block

Variables:
==========

Variables are called as memory holders, which is used to store the data , send the data inside a class or across all the classfiles

To create this varaibles, one must define  the type of data that a variable get store


Telling the type of data is called as "Datatypes"

This datatypes re available in 2 ways

	* Primitive datatype
	* Non-Primitive datatype






Under Primitive :

int
boolean
char
long
double
float
short
byte


NonPrimitive:
Arrays,Strings etc...


How can i create a variable?

This will be happen in 2 steps

Step 1: Declaration

Step 2: Intialization

Declartion:

syntax: datatype variableName;

in java each statement must end with a semicolon

When we declare a variable a space will be created inside the memory block

Intialization:

Assigning value or setting the value inside the memory block is called as  Intialization

syntax: variableName=somevalue;

********************************************

datatype variableName;//decl
variableName=somevalue;//ins

Is there any other way to write to create a variable

Yes both declarationb and intialization can be do in a same line

syntax:datatype variableName=somevalue;

When you know that all the variavbles are belongs to same type
can we declar and assign them all together?

Yes:

Syntax:
datatype var1,var2,var3,var4..varn;

var1=var2=var3=Somevalue;



Statement:

I have created a variable z with somename, but i didnt store anyvalue into it

i have create another variable called as some x and i assigned x=30;


now i wrote the expression as 

z=z+30;

what will be the outout?

This behave differently;

When we use this logioc inside a main method, you will be getting a compile error
syaing that z is not intialized


Note:
Inside a method if you declared a variable but not intialized, when you use the unintialized variable, JVM will throw an exception saying the unintialized variables can not be used.


I have an expression as below
		int x,z;
		z=0;
		x=30;
		
		
		z=z+x;
		
		System.out.println(z);

How z is storing 30 not zero?
in java a variable can store max of one value

whenwe re-intilized a variable the old value will get overwrite.



Problem Statement 1:

I have 2 variables say x and y each of them have different values say as 10 and 20

if i print x i should get 20

if i print y should get 10

Conditions :do not use any other variable except x and y



Problem Statement 2:

I have 2 variables say x and y each of them have different values say as 50 and 80

Assume those are ages of two persons

Format a string and print that "Age of Person 1 is ***** and age of person 2 is ***"
