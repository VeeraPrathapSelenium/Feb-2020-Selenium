Variables in java:
====================

What is meant by a variable and why should i need to learn?

Variables are called as memeory holders to store the data or to send the data in the java program

in java if we want to get the value of a variable , we must retrive by its name

it means that every variavle will be having a unique name;l

how can i create a variable?

as we discussed variables rae used to store the data.

Again this data isize is considered.

We must specify to the compiler how much of space is required

It means that we must need to specify that what kind of data we are going to store inside a variable


specifying the type of data is called as "Datatype"
Datatypes are available in 2 types

	* Primitive types
	* Non-Primitive

Primitive:
==============
int -----inumber of small size 
float------ decimals
boolean--- true or false
double--- decimals with large 
long---integer with large 
short
byte
char----- single character

Non -Primitive:
===============
String,Arrays,Integer,Boolean etc



Synatx to create a variable:
----------------------------
----------------------------

datatype variablename; // declaration
variablename=someValue;// intilization



Can i do variable declration and intializationis same line?

Yes.


I have 3 varaibles of same type and i need to assign same value for all of these 3 variables, can i do that?

Yes., but how?
