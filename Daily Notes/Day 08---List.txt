Problem statement:
--------------------------
I have a list of students who are part of section or class

I have a lsit of student who are in music class.
now i need to verify if these music class students are part of actual section or not.

Hint : very if list 2 is a subset of list1


yes we can do this using a method called "containsAll()"

list1.conatainsAll(list2)

this method will return a boolean value.



To use Aggregate functions, on the collection object called list we must use the methods which are available under a class called Collections

Note that , most of us will get confused here that

Collection is an interface
Collections is an utility class

Ex: I have a list having all the salary details of emplyees
i want sort the list
