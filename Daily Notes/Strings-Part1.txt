Strings:

String are called as immutable

Strings will always represent in double quotes

Strings is group of words special symbol, numerics etc

Any thing that represent in double quotes we name it as string

This string concept is very importnat.

One must understand how string will get memory allocated

Understand what are the different ways of creating a string

What is type of memory allocated everytime when you create a string

Understand the importance of "==" and .equals()


String as a immutable:
======================
Can create in two different ways

1.Using String as an datatype
2.Using String constructor


String s="india";//string as a datatype
		
String str=new String("Hello");//using constructor

When we declare a string with String datatype, the memory will choosen as String Constant Pool Memeory

How memory allocation will be happen of a string in SCP:
--------------------------------------------------------
When we declare a string with the datatype, it will directly go into the SCP, and check if there is a match with contenet is avcailable, 

if there is no match available, then it will create a new memory block

if there is amatch available, then it will share the memeory block

When we create a String with string constructor,it will be go directly in to the heap memeory.
When ever we create a String with the constructor, every time a new memory block will be created.



Why "==" and equals() are important?

== is used to compare two numbers

When we apply == on strings,it will compare the memory address.

When we create a String with the string datatype, and if we use ==, As both of the strings are mapped to same memory address, we will always get compare with memeory address only but not with the content

So we always get "true"


.equals() is method which is used to compare the conetent of string


MethodS:
==============
equals():
This method is used to compare the conetent of string
Syntax:
String1.equals(String2)

Note:Case sensitive is matter 

equalsIgnoreCase():
This method is used to compare the strings by ignoring the cases of String

contentEquals()
This method is used to comapre with definete content of a string.
It works same as like equals method

toUpperCase() 
this method isued to convert the given string into upper case

toLower()
this method is used to convert the given String into lower case

length():

this method is used to get length of a given of given source String

it include white spaces also

trim():
this method isused to remove the spaces in starting and at ending of the given source string.

it will not remove teh spce in between

charAt():
this method is used to get the character by character from user given index position

toCharArray()
this method is used to convert the string as an character array.

substring()

this method is used to get or crop the sequence of characters

In substring second parameter is always an optional

if we dont specify the second parameter, it will crop the entire string from where you have given
