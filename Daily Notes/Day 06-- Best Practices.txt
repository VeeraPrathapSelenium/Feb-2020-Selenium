Best Practise to follow:
========================

1.Variable name must meaningfull probobly it should be relavant to the process that we are working on

x,y,z

Your variable must speak , what exactly it is storing

username
password
age

2.Variable name must be too length, it should be readable

3.Variable name should not have any spaces in between

4.We can use "_" to separe the names of the variable

5.No other speacial character is allowed to have in the variable name other than "_"

6.mostly for better practive we give variablename starting with small letters and proceed with capital 

ex:userName;

7.Can not starts with a numeric, but a numeric can be at anyplace other than starting position.

8.A variable can start with underscore

9.a variable is still a case sensitive

10.A avariable can be reintialized, but not redeclared
11.A variable can hold only one value at a time
12.it is always good to have a comment before  your logic, such taht the reviewer or your peer will understand what the logic for

Comments:

Readable note , which will be ignored by the compiler
comments are of two types

	* Single line comments--->> //
	* multiline comments-->/* ....*/

When we create a method allways have proper headers attached to it
