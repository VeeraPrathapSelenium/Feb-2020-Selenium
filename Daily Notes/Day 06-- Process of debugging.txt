Debugging:
============

what do you mean by debugging?

Analyzing line by line code in run time is called debugging.

debugging will make the user to understand how the variable values and flow execution is running in the application

it helps the user to fix the code related issue.


though your are very new to the project, and if some one asked you to analyze the code by your own

How to start debugging process?

First we must need to insert a break point.

what is meant by a breakpoint?

it is the place from where you need to do the debugging.

2.Run the program in debugmode

once we started debugging there 3 steps to keep in mind

	* Step over
	* Step into
	* Step out
step Over:

this is used  in 2 ways

1.debug line by line code
2.while debugging you came across a method, now if you dont want to go inside the method and anlyse the code available in the method , we can simply sip the method by using stepover

here skip mean , it will execute the logic available inside teh method, but we will not get eneter into the method
