conditional satements are used to alter the flow of execution based on some user given conditions


what type of conditions can we write?

equals (==)
greater than (>)
lessthan (<)
greater than equal (>=)
lessthan or equal(<=)

and (&&)
or  (||)
not (!)

conditional statements:
=======================

simple if
if else
else if
switch 
(nested )



simple if:
checking only for a true condition.

here it will check if the condition is true, if the condition is true then only the body will get execute

syntax:

if (somecondition){
//Body
}

if else:
=======
when the if condition is not true, without checking any other condition it will execute the code available in the else block

syntax:


if(somecondition)
{

// logic here

}else{
//alternative logic here
}

else if:
=========
if the main if condition is failed,checking for alternative if condition is called  else if condition

if(somecondition)
{
//some logic
}
else if(some condition){
//some logic
}
else if(some logic)
{
//some logic
}
else
{
//optional not mandatory
}

Writting toomany else if conditions is not a optimal way

eridate this with replacing else if with switch cases.

when you know what are the possible condition , if it is more than one then , use directly switch case

switch case will not check each condition, if there is a matching condition (case) exist , it will execute only that particular case or condition alone
