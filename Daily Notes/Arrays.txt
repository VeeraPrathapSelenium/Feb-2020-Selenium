Arrays:

Arrays are used to store collection of items of same datatype

Arrays are are size based 

Once you declared the size we can not change it

Arrays are called as homogenius

All the elements we store inside an array will be store at respective index position

index will start from 0

To get the length of an array method length is used.

Array is an iteratble for a for , while , do while and for each


Syntax:

ClassName[] someName=new ClassName[Size]

ClassName[] someName={}

How to add an item to the array?
ClassName[] someName=new ClassName[Size]
someName[index position]=some value

indexposition must be less than the size given.

if you violated the above rule, you wil get an expection array index out of bound exception.



How to get an item from an array?
Through idex.

Syntax:

variablename[index]



for each(dataype somename:collectionobject)
{

sysout(somename)
}



As we came to know that , Arrays are homogenius, to overcome that ,hetrogenius arrays were introduced.

in java for every class, the parent class is called as "Object" class.


Thsi Object class provide an array called "Object" array

This Object array can store of any type of data
